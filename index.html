          ~ potion ~

          Potion is an object- and mixin-oriented (traits)
          language.

          Its exciting points are:

          * Just-in-time compilation to x86 and x86-64
          machine code function pointers. This means
          she's a speedy one. Who integrates very
          well with C extensions.

          The JIT is turned on by default and is
          considered the primary mode of operation.

          * Intermediate bytecode format and VM. Load
          and dump code. Decent speed and cross-
          architecture. Heavily based on Lua's VM.

          * A lightweight generational GC, based on
          Basile Starynkevitch's work on Qish, with
          ~4ms per GC on average with < 100MB heaps.
          <http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/qishintro.html>

          * Bootstrapped "id" object model, based on
          Ian Piumarta's soda languages. This means
          everything in the language, including
          object allocation and interpreter state
          are part of the object model.

  <h2>Tip 26: write long, funny, angry comments</h2>
  <pre class="c" style="font-size: 12pt; width: 100%"><code>
  // At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD format.
  // PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it such would be an
  // insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having
  // worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire
  // that burns with the fierce passion of a million suns.
  // If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in different
  // places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would think of, and do those
  // too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for instance, did it suddenly decide
  // that *these* particular chunks should be aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement
  // should *not* be included in the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned,
  // or aligned with the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included.
  // Either one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD,
  // of course, uses all three, and more.
  // Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the attic of
  // your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th
  // birthday. That last detail may not be important for the purposes of the simile, but
  // at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing fates for the people
  // responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.
  // Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format. To do this,
  // I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have them consider sending
  // me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing them a copy of some document or
  // other, probably signed in blood. I can only imagine that they make this process so
  // difficult because they are intensely ashamed of having created this abomination. I
  // was naturally not gullible enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done
  // so, I would have printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire.
  // Were it within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch
  // them on a spaceship directly into the sun.
  //
  // PSD is not my favourite file format.

  <h2>Tip 27: reimplement the internet with birds</h2>
  <blockquote><p>IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to user error),[2] and a response time ranging from 3000 seconds (~54 minutes) to over 6000 seconds (~1.77 hours). </p></blockquote>

  <h2>Tip 28: reimplement the internet with ambiguity</h2>
  <blockquote style="font-size: 22pt"><p>UDP was actually “designed” in 30 minutes on
  a blackboard when we decided pull the original TCP protocol
  apart into TCP and IP, and created UDP on top of IP as an
  alternative for multiplexing and demultiplexing IP datagrams
  inside a host among the various host processes or tasks. But
  it was a placeholder that enabled all the
  non-virtual-circuit protocols since ... without [people's] having to
  negotiate for permission either to define a new protocol or
  to extend TCP by adding “features”.</p></blockquote>
